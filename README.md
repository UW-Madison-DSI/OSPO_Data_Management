## Project Goals

The project repository will represent a stand-alone tool to obtain data from various open code repositories, user contributions and organized submissions and store them in a central database. The tool will provide the ability to cross-link repositories to journal publications, individuals, grants and other data resources to allow researchers and administrators to assess the impact of open source contributions.

In addition, the database will be constructed in such a way that it will provide additional support to researchers themselves, by identifying opportunities for improvement though simple Open Source checklists, that will allow researchers to ensure a high level of quality in their open source contributions.
